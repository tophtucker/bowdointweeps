=============

Bowdoin alumni sorted by number of Twitter followers.

The way this works is currently very low-tech: I run `generate.php` and manually save the html output as the static `index.html`. Yeah yeah, I'll improve.

`generate.php` takes an array of Twitter lists, fetches all members, orders & de-dupes. That's the gist of it.

Some historical data is in `/archives`, again as staic html. Gonna get a database solution up and running so we can track rankings over time.
